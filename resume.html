    <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <p>
        I completed a 2.5-month internship as a Website Development Intern at APEX | SYS, 
        where I gained hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end web development. 
        During this internship, I worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL to develop and 
        maintain web applications. I successfully completed assigned tasks within deadlines, 
        demonstrating strong time management, discipline, and problem-solving skills. 
        I worked under the guidance of trainers and the operations team to support 
        web-based projects, gaining practical exposure to real-world development workflows. 
        My performance and dedication were recognized with a formal certificate of completion 
        and positive feedback for my contribution and teamwork.
